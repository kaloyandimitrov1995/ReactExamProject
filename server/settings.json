            "content": "The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote-code execution (RCE) via a bug in how React deserialises payloads for Server Components. Affected versions: React Server-Component packages 19.0, 19.1, 19.1.1, 19.2.0 (react-server-dom-webpack / parcel / turbopack). Patched versions released: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1. Risk: Even apps that don’t explicitly define Server Functions may be vulnerable if they support Server Components. ",
